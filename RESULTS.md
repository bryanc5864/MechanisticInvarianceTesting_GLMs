## Overview

This benchmark evaluates whether genomic language models (gLMs) encode the mechanistic logic of regulatory compensation in E. coli σ70 promoters. The primary metric is the **Compensation Sensitivity Score (CSS)**, which measures how often a model scores compensated sequences higher than broken sequences.

- **CSS > 0.5**: Model recognizes compensation
- **CSS = 0.5**: Model cannot distinguish (random baseline)
- **CSS < 0.5**: Model penalizes compensated sequences

> Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction applied across all tests.

## Key Findings

1. **HyenaDNA is the only tested model showing statistically significant compensation sensitivity** (CSS=0.630, FDR-corrected p=0.0258), but extended experiments reveal this signal is driven by AT content correlation rather than mechanistic understanding.

2. **No tested model shows significant structure sensitivity**: SCR is indistinguishable from 0.5 for all models (FDR-corrected p > 0.05), indicating models respond similarly to structured and scrambled compensatory elements.

3. **NT-500M shows no significant compensation sensitivity**: CSS=0.540 (FDR-corrected p=0.640), with SCR=0.400 indicating no structure sensitivity. NT-500M also shows near-zero MES (-0.00 natural, -0.10 synthetic), consistent with indifference to motif identity.

4. **Negative MES across models**: All gLMs tested score intact sequences (TATAAT) *lower* than broken (TGTAAT), suggesting they have learned genome-wide frequency priors that contradict functional importance (see [Negative MES Investigation](#negative-mes-investigation)).

5. **PWM baseline achieves CSS=0.000** because it evaluates only the -35 and -10 boxes, giving identical scores to broken and compensated sequences (both have the same broken -10).

## Sequence Classes

| Class | Name | N | Description |
|-------|------|---|-------------|
| A | Natural Intact | 100 | Real promoters with strong -10 box |
| B | Natural Broken | 100 | Real promoters with mutated -10, no compensation |
| C | Synthetic Intact | 100 | Consensus -35 (TTGACA) and -10 (TATAAT) |
| D | Synthetic Broken | 100 | Consensus -35, broken -10 (TGTAAT) |
| E | Synthetic Compensated | 100 | Broken -10 + UP element + extended -10 |
| F | Over-Compensated | 50 | Broken -10 + all compensatory elements |
| G | Natural Compensated | 50 | Real promoters with compensation |
| H | Scrambled Control | 50 | Same composition as E, scrambled motifs |

**Total: 650 sequences**

## Deep Analysis: What Is HyenaDNA Actually Learning?

### The Composition Effect

Analysis reveals that HyenaDNA's CSS signal is primarily driven by **nucleotide composition**, not positional motif logic:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Correlation(LL, AT content) | **r = 0.784** |
| Mean UP-region AT (Class D - Broken) | 57.8% |
| Mean UP-region AT (Class E - Compensated) | 82.1% |

The strong correlation (r=0.784) between log-likelihood and AT content explains why HyenaDNA prefers compensated sequences: they contain AT-rich UP elements.

### Positional Ablation Test

To distinguish compositional from positional effects, we created sequences with UP elements in the **wrong position** (after -10 instead of before -35):

| Condition | Mean LL | vs Correct (15) |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Original (UP at pos 15) | -139.83 | -- |
| Mispositioned (UP at pos 70) | -140.29 | -0.46 |
| No UP | -143.53 | -3.70 |

**Key finding**: Moving the UP element to the wrong position reduces LL by only 0.46, while removing it entirely reduces LL by 3.70. The compositional effect (3.70) is **8x larger** than the positional effect (0.46).

HyenaDNA shows almost no positional awareness; the dominant signal is AT composition.

### The Scramble Control Problem

The SCR = 0.48 (p=0.712, not significant) indicates HyenaDNA responds **identically** to:
- Structured compensation: `AAAAAAGCA` (real UP) + `TGT` (extended -10)
- Scrambled compensation: `TAGAAAAAA` (shuffled) + `TGT` (same)

### Negative MES Investigation

Counter-intuitively, all tested gLMs score synthetic **intact** sequences (TATAAT) **lower** than broken (TGTAAT). We investigated this by computing expected hexamer frequencies under E. coli genome composition:

| Hexamer | Expected Frequency | Ratio vs TATAAT |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| TATAAT (intact) | 2.216e-4 | 1.000x |
| TGTAAT (broken) | 2.288e-4 | 1.033x |

Under the independence assumption with E. coli nucleotide frequencies (G: 25.4% vs A: 24.6%), TGTAAT is 1.033x more frequent than TATAAT. All 12 G/C-containing variants of TATAAT have higher expected frequency than the consensus, because G/C are slightly more common than A/T in E. coli.

**Biophysical models correctly rank intact > broken** (with position-aligned scoring):
- PA-PWM: TATAAT score = 18.69, TGTAAT score = 14.16 (intact correctly higher)
- Thermo: TATAAT score = 26.42, TGTAAT score = 20.64 (intact correctly higher)

Moreover, biophysical model scores are *negatively* correlated with hexamer frequency (PA-PWM: r=-0.827, Thermo: r=-0.762), meaning they correctly assign highest scores to the functional consensus despite it being slightly less frequent in the genome.

**Key insight**: Biophysical models rank intact > broken because they encode *functional importance*, not *statistical frequency*. gLMs have learned frequency priors that contradict biological function at this critical regulatory position.

See `scripts/experiment_negative_mes.py` for full analysis of all 18 single-nucleotide -10 variants.

## Interpretation

HyenaDNA exhibits statistically significant compensation sensitivity (CSS=0.630, FDR-corrected p=0.0258), but this appears to be driven by a learned heuristic: **"AT-rich upstream sequences correlate with functional promoters."**

This is technically correct -- UP elements are AT-rich and do enhance transcription (Estrem et al. 1998; Ross et al. 1993). However, the tested models fail to encode the **positional logic** that makes this work biologically:

1. UP elements must be at specific positions relative to -35
2. The extended -10 (TGT) must be immediately upstream of -10
3. Scrambling these elements should destroy function

The positional ablation shows the compositional effect is 8x larger than the positional effect, indicating position is a negligible signal.

### Conclusion

> The tested gLMs capture **statistical associations** between sequence features and regulatory function, but fail to encode the **positional logic** that underlies mechanistic compensation in bacterial transcription. These results apply to the models and regulatory system tested here; additional model architectures and regulatory contexts should be evaluated to assess generality.

## Extended Experiments

All extended experiments were re-run with full logging via `scripts/run_all_experiments.py`. Logs are available in `logs/`.

### Experiment 2.1: AT Titration

**Question**: Does LL correlate with background AT content, independent of motifs?

| AT% | Intact LL | Broken LL | Compensated LL |
|-----|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 30% | -144.3 | -142.1 | -142.6 |
| 40% | -147.0 | -145.6 | -143.5 |
| 50% | -145.6 | -144.6 | -140.8 |
| 60% | -140.1 | -140.0 | -136.3 |
| 70% | -131.4 | -131.7 | -130.2 |
| 80% | -122.9 | -124.2 | -123.6 |

**Overall AT-LL Correlation: r = 0.784**

**Key Finding**: LL increases ~21 units from AT=30% to AT=80%. The AT effect dominates; motif differences are small and inconsistent.

---

### Experiment 3.1: Positional Sweep

**Question**: Does HyenaDNA care where the UP element is located?

| UP Position | Mean LL | vs Correct (15) |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| 0 | -139.34 | +0.49 |
| 5 | -139.62 | +0.21 |
| 10 | -139.86 | -0.03 |
| **15** | **-139.83** | **0.00** |
| 20 | -139.92 | -0.08 |
| 25 | -142.37 | -2.53 |
| 35 | -139.94 | -0.11 |
| 45 | -142.00 | -2.17 |
| 60 | -140.32 | -0.49 |
| 70 | -140.29 | -0.46 |
| 80 | -139.76 | +0.07 |
| None | -143.53 | -3.70 |

**Key Findings**:
1. **UP effect (15 vs None): +3.70** - Having AT-rich content helps substantially
2. **Position effect (15 vs 70): +0.46** - Position barely matters
3. Positions 25 and 45 are worst because UP overlaps -35 box or -10 box, disrupting their consensus and lowering LL

---

### Experiment 3.2: Spacing Sensitivity

**Question**: Does HyenaDNA know the optimal 17bp spacing between -35 and -10?

| Spacing | Mean LL | vs Optimal (17bp) |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| 12bp | -143.47 | -1.20 |
| 13bp | -142.71 | -0.44 |
| **14bp** | **-141.79** | **+0.48** |
| 15bp | -142.87 | -0.60 |
| 16bp | -142.66 | -0.40 |
| 17bp | -142.27 | 0.00 |
| 18bp | -142.19 | +0.08 |
| 19bp | -142.84 | -0.57 |
| 20bp | -143.12 | -0.85 |
| 22bp | -142.27 | +0.00 |
| 25bp | -143.10 | -0.83 |

**Key Findings**:
1. **Peak at 14bp, not 17bp** - Wrong optimal spacing
2. **17bp is not special** - Not the highest scoring spacing
3. **Range only 1.67 LL units** - Essentially flat
4. HyenaDNA does not encode the biologically optimal -35/-10 spacing

---

### Experiment 3.3: Strand Orientation

**Question**: Does HyenaDNA know promoter elements are strand-specific?

| Condition | Mean LL | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Forward | -143.79 | Correct orientation |
| RC-in-place | -142.83 | RC motifs, same position |
| Full RC | -142.13 | Full reverse complement |
| Scrambled | -143.98 | Scrambled motifs |

**Key Findings**:
1. **All conditions within 1.85 LL** - No meaningful strand preference
2. **Forward vs RC-in-place: -0.95** - Forward is actually LOWER than RC (wrong direction)
3. **Forward vs Scrambled: +0.19** - Negligible difference
4. **Strand accuracy: 44%** - Worse than random coin flip

HyenaDNA does not exhibit strand awareness for promoter elements.

---

## Summary of All Experiments

| Experiment | Finding | Implication |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| AT Titration | r=0.784 correlation with AT% | Compositional, not motif-based |
| Positional Sweep | Compositional effect 8x positional | No meaningful positional encoding |
| Spacing | Peak at 14bp, not 17bp | Does not encode optimal spacing |
| Strand | Strand accuracy = 44% | Strand-blind |
| Scramble Control | SCR=0.48 (p=0.71) | Cannot distinguish structure from composition |
| Negative MES | Intact < Broken for all gLMs | Frequency priors contradict function |
| Dinucleotide Control | P(Comp > Match-AT) = 1.00 (biophys) | Position matters beyond AT% |
| Error Analysis | AT% diff predicts HyenaDNA success (p=1e-6) | Confirms AT-driven heuristic |
| PA-PWM Ablation | NoComp CSS=0.000, NoPos CSS=0.630 | Both compensation + position needed |

### Conclusion

The tested gLMs appear to have learned a simple heuristic: **"AT-rich sequences are more likely."**

This heuristic happens to correlate with promoter function (UP elements are AT-rich), producing apparent "compensation sensitivity" (CSS=0.630). However, the models fail every mechanistic test we applied:

1. Position doesn't matter (compositional effect 8x larger)
2. Spacing doesn't matter (peak at 14bp, not 17bp)
3. Strand doesn't matter (44% accuracy)
4. Motif sequence doesn't matter (SCR=0.48, p=0.71)
5. AT content dominates (r=0.784)
6. Error analysis confirms AT%-driven successes (p=1e-6)

In contrast, biophysical models with explicit positional and compensation logic achieve CSS=1.000 and SCR=0.980. Ablation shows removing compensation logic produces CSS=0.000 (tied scores), and removing positional encoding produces CSS=0.630 — matching HyenaDNA exactly.

These results are consistent with **shallow statistical learning** rather than **mechanistic understanding** of promoter regulation.

---

## Biophysical Model Comparison

To demonstrate that the mechanistic tests are solvable, we implemented biophysical models with explicit positional encoding, plus ablation variants to address the concern that PA-PWM is "tuned to win."

### Models

1. **PA-PWM (Position-Aware PWM)**: Scores -35/-10 boxes at expected positions with spacing and compensation bonuses
2. **PA-PWM-NoComp (Ablation)**: Same as PA-PWM but without UP element or extended -10 scoring — tests whether compensation-specific logic is required
3. **PA-PWM-NoPos (Ablation)**: Scans for best motif matches anywhere with no positional constraints — tests whether positional encoding matters
4. **Thermo (Thermodynamic)**: Free energy-based binding model with positional constraints
5. **Scan (Position-Scanning)**: Finds best motifs, then penalizes deviation from expected positions

### Results (Benchmark Sequences)

| Model | Type | CSS | SCR | Notes |
|-------|------|-----|-----|-------|
| **PA-PWM** | Biophysical | **1.000** | **0.980** | Full positional + compensation |
| PA-PWM-NoComp | Ablation | 0.000† | 0.000† | No UP/ext-10 scoring |
| PA-PWM-NoPos | Ablation | 0.630 | 0.560 | No positional constraints |
| **Thermo** | Biophysical | **0.970** | **0.680** | Free energy model |
| HyenaDNA | gLM | 0.630 | 0.480 | AT-driven |
| NT-500M | gLM | 0.540 | 0.400 | Not significant |
| GROVER | gLM | 0.520 | 0.520 | Near random |
| Random | Baseline | 0.500 | 0.460 | Random baseline |
| Scan | Biophysical | 0.430 | 0.540 | Weak position scanning |
| k-mer | Baseline | 0.430 | 0.500 | Composition baseline |

> †PA-PWM-NoComp gives CSS=0.000 because all 100 D/E pairs score identically (tied): the model reads only -35 and -10, which are the same in both broken and compensated sequences. This confirms compensation-specific logic is required.

### Extended Results (Position-Matched Comparison)

The biophysical comparison script generates its own sequences and tests additional capabilities:

| Model | CSS | SCR | Pos Acc | Spacing Peak | Strand Acc |
|-------|-----|-----|---------|--------------|------------|
| PA-PWM | 1.000 | 0.970 | 0.980 | 17bp | 1.000 |
| PA-PWM-NoComp | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 17bp | 1.000 |
| PA-PWM-NoPos | 0.660 | 0.510 | 0.200 | 18bp | 1.000 |
| Thermo | 1.000 | 0.830 | 0.470 | 17bp | 1.000 |
| Scan | 0.440 | 0.420 | 0.290 | 17bp | 0.980 |
| HyenaDNA | 0.630 | 0.480 | 0.580 | 20bp | 0.530 |

### Ablation Analysis

The PA-PWM ablations address the critique that "PA-PWM is tuned to win":

1. **PA-PWM-NoComp** (no compensation logic): Removing UP element and extended -10 scoring makes it impossible to distinguish D from E (CSS=0.000, all pairs tied). D and E have identical -35 (TTGACA) and -10 (TGTAAT), differing only in compensatory elements. This confirms the compensation-specific logic is necessary — general positional encoding of core elements is not enough.

2. **PA-PWM-NoPos** (no positional encoding): Scanning for motifs anywhere produces CSS=0.630 with SCR=0.560 — nearly identical to HyenaDNA (CSS=0.630, SCR=0.480). Without positional constraints, even a model with explicit compensation logic performs only at the gLM level.

### Key Findings

1. **PA-PWM achieves CSS=1.000** vs HyenaDNA's 0.630 — explicit compensation logic at correct positions perfectly detects compensation
2. **PA-PWM has SCR=0.980** — strongly distinguishes structured from scrambled motifs (vs HyenaDNA at 0.480)
3. **Removing compensation logic drops CSS to 0.000** — without UP/ext-10 scoring, D and E are indistinguishable
4. **Removing positional encoding drops CSS to 0.630 and SCR to 0.560** — matches HyenaDNA, confirming that positional constraints are what separates biophysical from gLM performance

### Interpretation

This comparison demonstrates that:
1. The mechanistic tests ARE solvable with explicit biological knowledge
2. The tested gLMs have not learned equivalent mechanistic principles
3. Both compensation logic AND positional encoding are needed — removing either one makes the model perform at or below gLM level
4. ~100 parameters of explicit biological knowledge (PWM weights, positions, spacing rules) outperform gLMs with orders of magnitude more parameters on these mechanistic tests

## Critique-Addressing Experiments

The following experiments were added to address specific reviewer critiques of the initial results.

### Dinucleotide Frequency Control

**Critique addressed**: "Only controlled for AT content — maybe the effect is dinucleotide patterns."

We generated sequences with matched compositions to distinguish mononucleotide (AT%) from dinucleotide from positional effects:

| Condition | AT% | AA freq | AT freq | TA freq |
|-----------|-----|---------|---------|---------|
| Compensated | 0.599 | 0.123 | 0.078 | 0.072 |
| Match-AT | 0.622 | 0.089 | 0.098 | 0.090 |
| Match-Dinuc | 0.613 | 0.121 | 0.085 | 0.073 |
| Broken | 0.578 | 0.077 | 0.087 | 0.077 |

**PA-PWM validation** (biophysical ground truth, position-aligned):

| Comparison | P(X > Y) | Interpretation |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| P(Compensated > Broken) | **1.000** | Compensation perfectly detected |
| P(Match-AT > Broken) | 0.530 | AT alone ≈ random |
| P(Match-Dinuc > Broken) | 0.710 | Dinucs provide partial signal |
| P(Compensated > Match-AT) | **1.000** | Position matters beyond AT% |
| P(Compensated > Match-Dinuc) | **0.980** | Position matters beyond dinucs |

**Key finding**: The position-aligned biophysical model perfectly distinguishes real compensated sequences from all composition-matched controls. Match-AT sequences (same AT% but random arrangement) score near chance against broken, while real compensated sequences with motifs at correct positions score higher 100% of the time. This confirms the CSS signal in biophysical models is positional, not compositional. gLM inference on these sequences would test whether gLMs can make the same distinction.

See `scripts/experiment_dinucleotide_control.py` for full implementation.

### Error Analysis

**Critique addressed**: "No analysis of which sequences models get right vs wrong."

We analyzed which D/E pairs each model classifies correctly (compensated > broken) vs incorrectly.

**HyenaDNA** (CSS=0.630, 63 correct, 37 incorrect):

| Property | Correct pairs | Incorrect pairs | p-value |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| AT% difference (E - D) | +0.035 | -0.026 | **1.0e-6 *** |
| AT% of compensated seq | 0.617 | 0.583 | **4.0e-4 *** |
| AT% of broken seq | 0.582 | 0.609 | **0.005 ** |
| Max AT run (compensated) | 8.83 | 7.76 | **0.014 * ** |
| Upstream AT% (compensated) | 0.639 | 0.597 | **0.022 * ** |

HyenaDNA succeeds when the compensated sequence has higher AT% than the broken sequence, and fails when the broken sequence happens to have higher AT%. This confirms the AT-driven heuristic.

**GROVER** (CSS=0.520, 52 correct, 48 incorrect):
AT% difference is also significant (p=0.002), suggesting the same AT-driven mechanism at a weaker level.

**Cross-model agreement** (HyenaDNA vs GROVER): ~67% agreement rate. Models fail on partially overlapping but not identical sequence subsets, suggesting a shared compositional bias with model-specific noise.

See `scripts/experiment_error_analysis.py` for full results.

### MPRA Cross-Reference Validation

**Critique addressed**: "No experimental validation — compensated sequences assumed functional."

We generated a 500-sequence MPRA-like library with systematic variation of -35, -10, UP elements, extended -10, and spacing. The biophysical model (ThermodynamicModel) serves as a validated proxy for experimental expression:
- Estrem et al. 1998: UP elements provide 30-fold activation
- Ross et al. 1993: AT-rich upstream regions enhance transcription
- Hawley & McClure 1983: -10 mutations reduce activity >100-fold

The library is saved to `data/results/mpra_library.json` for gLM inference. The correlation between gLM scores and biophysical scores would provide a proxy for how well gLMs predict real expression.

See `scripts/experiment_mpra_validation.py` for implementation.

---

## Limitations

1. **Model coverage**: Results are from 3 gLMs (HyenaDNA, GROVER, NT-500M) plus baselines. DNABERT-2, Caduceus, and Evo2 should be tested to assess generality across architectures. Support for these models has been added to `run_all_experiments.py`. NT-500M was scored using pseudo-log-likelihood (PLL).

2. **Single regulatory system**: All experiments use E. coli σ70 promoters. Eukaryotic enhancers, yeast promoters, or other bacterial sigma factors may show different patterns.

3. **No wet-lab validation**: We use published literature and biophysical models as proxies for experimental validation. Direct MPRA validation of our synthetic sequences would strengthen claims.

4. **Scoring method**: NT-500M uses proper pseudo-log-likelihood (PLL) scoring. GROVER uses mean embedding values as proxy scores rather than true PLL, which may underestimate its capabilities.

5. **Claim scope**: Our conclusions apply to the specific models, promoter system, and mechanistic tests evaluated here. We do not claim these findings generalize to all gLMs or all regulatory contexts.
